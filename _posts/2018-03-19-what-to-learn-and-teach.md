You don't need to book, please, just turn up.

Here are the [talk
slides](https://github.com/matthew-brett/thw-intro/blob/master/thw_uob.pdf).

Look at [the Github repository](https://github.com/matthew-brett/thw-intro)
for the source material to generate the slides, including copyright
information.

After the talk, I mentioned our [Berkeley course on reproducible
science](http://www.jarrodmillman.com/rcsds).  If you want to see what the
students managed to do in their final projects, have a look at the course
[Github organization](https://github.com/berkeley-stat159) for the students
project repositories, beginning with `project-`.  For example
[project-alpha](https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-alpha).
