* when: Monday 25th June, 1-2pm.
* where: Murray Learning Centre UG07
* what: Language Gallery

We've been talking about different languages used for academic computing, and one topic that has come up several times is - which language should I use?

In this meeting, we talk about these 4 popular languages, each of which are
more or less essential in their own niche:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/about) - Warrick Ball. [Get Warrick's
  slides](../slides/ball_python_THW_20180625.pdf).
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) - Murray Hoggett.  [Get example
  code and data

* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com) - David Madden.  [Get David's
  slides](../slides/madden_javascript.pdf).
* [Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - Dietmar Heinke.

There was a 10 minute talk on each, in which someone who uses the language said
something about what the language is good for, why it's good, and when it's not
so good.
