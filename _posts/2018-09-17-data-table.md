# A brief introduction to data.table" or "If Thor was an R Programmer, His Hammer Would Be data.table"

## Abstract

In this 20-minutes talk, I will present basic examples of the use of
`data.table` which is an R package that provides an enhanced version of
`data.frame`s.  I will also share some of my experiences with `data.table` and
`ggplot2` for time-series analyses.  Slides and exercise are available here:
