- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org) - a fantastic
  resource for learning Git, in particular branching, rebasing, cherry-picking
  and working with remotes.  Presents a set of lessons, each followed by a task
  in the web-based terminal to test your knowledge.  We will definitely be
  using it to train people in the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit in the
  future (Matt Hill).
